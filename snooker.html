	<h1><marquee>SNOOKER</marquee></h1>
	<p><b>British Army officers stationed in India modified the traditional billiards and devised snooker. Snooker is a game played on a billiards board with 15 red balls, six balls of other colours, and a white cue ball in which we have to pot the other balls using the cue ball. Some play snooker as a recreational game while some play it for money and prestige. It may seem ordinary but there is so much to this game. It can be considered as example of applied physics and geometry. Some of its benefits include enhancing focus and coordination, and promoting self confidence if you are good at this game.</b></p>

	<p><b>Snooker</b> is a <abbr title="Cue sports also known as billiard sports are a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick, which is used to strike billiard balls and thereby cause them to move around a cloth-covered billiards table bounded by elastic bumpers known as cushions."> cue sport</abbr> that originated among British Army officers stationed in India in the second half of the 19th century. It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth (or "baize"), with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a cue stick and 21 coloured balls, players must strike the white ball (or "cue ball") to pot the remaining balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual game (or frame), is won by the player scoring the most points. A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames.

Snooker gained its identity in 1884 when army officer Sir Neville Chamberlain, stationed in Ooty, Tamil Nadu, devised a set of rules that combined pyramid and black pool. The word snooker was a long-used military term for inexperienced or first-year personnel. The game grew in popularity in the United Kingdom, and the Billiards Association and Control Club was formed in 1919. It is now governed by <abbr title="The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), founded in 1968 and based in Bristol, the United Kingdom, is the governing body of men's professional snooker and English billiards. It owns and sets the official rules of the two sports and engages in promotional activities on behalf of the sports.">the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).</abbr>

The World Snooker Championship has taken place since 1927. Joe Davis, a key figure in the early growth of the sport, won the championship 15 straight times between 1927 and 1946. The "modern era" began in 1969 after the broadcaster BBC commissioned the snooker television show Pot Black and later began to air the World Championship in 1978. Key figures in the game were Ray Reardon in the 1970s, Steve Davis in the 1980s, and Stephen Hendry in the 1990s, each winning six or more World championships. Since 2000, Ronnie O'Sullivan has won the most world titles, with five. Top professional players now compete regularly around the world and earn millions of pounds on the World Snooker Tour, which features players from across the world.</p>
